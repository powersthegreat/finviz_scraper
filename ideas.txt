For finviz_part_2, look through each sheet and check
off the standards, then return a 1 or 0 depending on 
if it checks or not to a dictionary with the ticker
and the corresponding 1 or 0 value. Then similarly to 
the tradingview scraper, rank the tickers by who has 
the largest number rating.

Tonight, research different index readings and their
considered 'good' values. Write out on paper, then 
convert into funciton/idk something else.
